# Easy-CSharp-Metaprogramming

This is a bit of a hobby project for now, not currently intended for production.

The current options for metaprogramming in C# are pretty lacking. It's either mostly just string manipulation or having to work with obtuse ASTs with poor documentation.

I hope I can offer a more user-friendly experience by using the builder pattern to construct C# code, which can then be outputted to a string.
